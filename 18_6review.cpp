Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmerâ€™s life. Donâ€™t be intimidated by themâ€¦ embrace them. 
Errors

 in your code mean youâ€™re trying to do something cool!

In this lesson, we have learned about the four types of C++ errors:

Compile-time errors: Errors found by the compiler.
Link-time errors: Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object 
files

 into an executable program.
Run-time errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.
Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
Remember, Google and Stack Overflow are a programmerâ€™s best friends. For some more motivation, 
check out this blog post: Thinking About Errors in Your Code Differently.

We wish you the best of luck in your bug-squashing journey.

1.
Optional: Because your friend didnâ€™t debug along the way, they ended up with a super buggy 
program. Can you be a bug detective and help them debug their program?

The final program should print a fortune message like:

ðŸ¥  Flattery will go far tonight.

Final tip: If you encounter a long error message, always scroll to the top and try to debug 
the very first bug.*/

#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    
  srand (time(NULL));
  int fortune = rand() % 10;
  
  if (fortune == 0) {

    std::cout << "Flattery will go far tonight.\n";
  
  } else if (fortune == 1) {
    
    std::cout << "Don't behave with cold manners.\n";
  
  } else if (fortune == 2) {
    
    std::cout << "May you someday be carbon neutral\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 3) {
    
    std::cout << "You have rice in your teeth.\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 4) {
    
    std::cout << "A conclusion is simply the place where you got tired of thinking.\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 5) {
    
    std::cout << "No snowflake feels responsible in an avalanche.\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 6) {
    
    std::cout << "He who laughs last is laughing at you.\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 7) {
    
    std::cout << "If you look back, you'll soon be going that way.\n";
    
  } else if (fortune == 8) {
    
    std::cout << "You will die alone and poorly dressed.\n";
      
  } else if (fortune == 9) {
    
    std::cout << "The fortune you seek is in another cookie.\n";
      
  }
