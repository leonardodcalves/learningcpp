Compile-time Errors
3 min
When we are writing C++ programs, the compiler is our first line of defense against 
errors
Preview: Docs In C++, errors help with locating and correcting problems within the source code.
.

There are two types of compile-time errors:

Syntax errors: Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
Type errors: Errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.
Some common syntax errors are:

Missing semicolon ;
Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }
Some common type errors are:

Forgetting to declare a variable
Storing a value into the wrong type
Hereâ€™s an example of a compile-time error message:

$ g++ example.cpp example.cpp: In function 'int main()': examplecpp:5:11: error: invalid conversion 
from 'const char*' to 'int' [-fpermissive] int x = "hello";

The compiler will tell us where (line number) it got into trouble and its best guess as to what is wrong.

Try compiling the code and find the compile-time error in millionaire.cpp.
