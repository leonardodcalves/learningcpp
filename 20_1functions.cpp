The Function of Functions

As a programmer, you will find yourself reusing the same blocks of code over and over throughout your program. In times like these, you can turn to 
functions

Also known as a method or procedure, a function is a named group of code statements that accomplish something together, a bit like a factory machine.

There are some great reasons to use functions in your code:

A single line can make all that code fire off instead of a whole bunch of lines.
You can build DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code, reusing the code you already wrote.
Functions help make your code flexible and modular, meaning you can group your code more easily by task.
In fact, every C++ program has at least one function. “Hold on,” you may be thinking, “I’ve written some C++ programs, but I haven’t written any functions yet!”

Well, as it happens, main() is a function that you’ve already used! And you’ll understand it a bit more as you learn how functions work.

Take a look at the IT support conversations in main.cpp. There’s a lot of repeating code.

Compile and execute the code. It works, but we could make this code much shorter and cleaner with the help of a function…
