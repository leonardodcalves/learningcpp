Functions
How Parameters & Arguments Work
1 min
A function with parameters has a couple of requirements:

The function call must include the same number of arguments as there are parameters.
The corresponding arguments must be passed in the same order.
By calling a function with arguments, you are telling a function, “Hey function, when 
you execute, use these values where you have parameters in your definition.”

While it executes, anywhere the function comes across a parameter, it replaces the parameter 
with the corresponding argument you gave it.

Instructions
Take a look at how our updated make_sandwich() function executes when it gets called 
with ingredients as arguments.
