/*Logical Operators
Introduction to Logical Operators
1 min
Often, when we are trying to create a control flow for our program, we’ll 
encounter situations where the logic cannot be satisfied with a single condition.
Logical operators (Perform operations on operands to manipulate data, 
make calculations, and control program flow in C++ programming.) are used 
to combine two or more conditions. They allow programs to make more flexible decisions.
The result of the operation of a logical operator is a bool value of either true or false.

There are three logical operators (Logical operators perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT 
to combine or modify boolean expressions in C++.) that we will cover:

&&: the and logical operator
||: the or logical operator
!: the not logical operator
We will also discuss the order of operations.
