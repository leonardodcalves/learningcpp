/*Logical Operators
Logical Operator: II
2 min
The or logical operator is denoted by ||.

It returns true when the condition on the left is true or the condition on the right is true. Only one of them needs to be true.

Hereâ€™s the truth table:

a	      b	    a || b
false	false	false
false	true	true
true	false	true
true	true	true

For instance:

( 1 < 2 || 2 > 3 ) returns true
( 1 > 2 || 2 > 3 ) returns false
Note: The keyword or can be used in the place of ||.
