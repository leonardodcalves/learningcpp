Congratulations! You have learned about how to store groups of data into 
vectors

 in C++. ðŸ™Œ

Here are some of the things that we learned:

Vectors are a sequence of elements that you can access by an index.
std::vector<int> even = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

Copy to Clipboard

The first index in a vector is 0.

Some of the 
functions

 that come with vectors:

.push_back()

.pop_back()

.size()
We can use a for loop to iterate through a vector.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Enabled
1.
Optional: Write a program to find the sum of even numbers and the product of 
odd numbers in a vector.

For example:

Suppose we have a vector that is {2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}.

Then the program should output:

Sum of even numbers is 12
Product of odd numbers is 27
