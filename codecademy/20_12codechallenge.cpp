Code Challenge: C++ Functions
How It Works
<1 min
Roll up your sleeves and get yourself in the mood for 
functions
Preview: Docs Functions are self-contained blocks of code designed to perform 
specific tasks, allowing for code reuse and modularity.
, because it’s code challenge time!

Say what? Here’s how it works:

Each exercise in this lesson has a C++ function for you to build.
Each challenge has many solutions, and we encourage you to be creative.
We don’t care what goes on in the function as long as it works the way it should. 
(Notice those tests in main() for each function.)
As a refresher, C++ function syntax looks like this:

return_type function_name(parameter1, parameter2) {

   // Code block here

   return output_if_there_is_any;

}

Copy to Clipboard

For example, with real code, this might look like:

bool is_even(int number) {

  if (number % 2 == 0) {

    return true;

  }

  return false;

}

Best of luck!
